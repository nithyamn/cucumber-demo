Tags:
@CucumberOptions:
tags = {"@tag1,@tag2"} -> tags = "@tag1 and @tag2" -> scenarios that have both the tags
                          tags = "@tag1 or @tag2" -> scenarios that have either of these tags

tags = {"~@tag1"} -> tags = "not @tag1" -> excluding scenarios that have this tag

Runners can run in parallel:
single.testng.xml has 3 runner files which will get triggered on running maven profile "single"
<parallel>classes</parallel>
<threadCount>2</threadCount>
2 runners will run in parallel first and then the 3rd runner will execute as the thread count is 2 (all the scenarios will also execute in parallel)

When no tags are specified feature files are picked up in alphabetical order (ASCII)
